# Multicut

It's time to start writing up my thesis and writing up all the theoretical foundations is fun ... not. So I thought insetead of just doing the dry theory write-ups I will do a series of blog posts discussing the topics in a lighter matter.
Also, as Feynman (ok, I know [bad role model](https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/surely-youre-a-creep-mr-feynman-mcneill?fbclid=IwAR2iHXFz3N0VtkUXoTq_6WtxAnma5q8z0V95vDMSdTE0KcPlsL9H5CoNuOQ)) or so said, you only understand something if you can explain it to your grandma.

To kick this off: the Multicut.
