	<h1>Random Thoughts</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my random thoughts blog. I will mostly right about my research and some software engineering, but how knows what other stuff I might come up with...  </p>
    <p> I am a Comp Sci PhD candidate at University of Heidelberg in <a href="https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/mip">Fred Hamprecht's group</a>, but I spend most of my time as visiting scientist at EMBL Heidelberg in <a href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/kreshuk/">the Kreshuk Group</a>.
    My research topic is Bio Image Analysis and I specialize in segmentaiton for Large Electron Microscopy volumes with applications in Connectomics and Evolutionary Biology. </p>
