I am a PhD student at EMBL Heidelberg and at the University of Heidelberg, working in the groups of [Anna Kreshuk](https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/kreshuk/index.html) and [Fred Hamprecht](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/mip).
I focus on the application of Machine Learning and Computer Vision for analysing large microscopy data, mostly working on image segmentation.
This includes [scaling algorithms to TB sized datasets](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/w1/html/Pape_Solving_Large_Multicut_ICCV_2017_paper.html), [developing new efficient algorithms](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Steffen_Wolf_The_Mutex_Watershed_ECCV_2018_paper.html) and [adapting algorithms for domain specific problems](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2019.00006/full).

I work in collaboration with several Biologists at EMBL, working on topics such as [understanding the evolutionary origins of cells in *Platynereis* and beyond](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.961037v1.abstract) or [unraveling the evolution of neural cells in sponges](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/758276v1.abstract).
