The world surely does not need another blog, so why make one?
Well everyone and your mama says you need one, so why not.
And maybe something useful will come of it, be it only learning a bit
about static webpages and jekyll.
So be prepared for (maybe) awesome content about:
- Deep Learning and Computer Vision for Bio Image Analysis
- Software engineering and Open Scource
- Whatever ...

And thanks for this [awesome guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to help get start it, highly recommend it!
